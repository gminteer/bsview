# Core functionality needed for minimum viable product

- File selection
  - Also, handling .rosz files (the default Battlescribe roster format, which is just a .ros file in a ZIP)
- Actual presentation
- Figuring out how to build release packages for various platforms

# Nice to haves

- De-duplicating units
- Attaching notes to the roster / detachments / units / tables / table rows
- Resolving variables like <REGIMENT> (I know other factions have similar mechanics)
  - Apply selection bonuses to stat blocks too?
- Wound tracking / merging vehicle wound tracks into the stat block
- Virtual dice rolling?
